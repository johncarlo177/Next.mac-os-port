# Formspree Email Configuration

Your form is set up with Formspree, but you need to configure it to send emails to `inmc050817@gmail.com`.

## Steps to Configure:

1. **Go to Formspree Dashboard**
   - Visit https://formspree.io/forms
   - Log in to your account
   - Find your form with ID `mzdpzljy`

2. **Set Email Recipient**
   - Click on your form
   - Go to "Settings" or "Email Settings"
   - Add `inmc050817@gmail.com` as the recipient email
   - Save the settings

3. **Verify Email (if required)**
   - Formspree may require you to verify the recipient email
   - Check your inbox at `inmc050817@gmail.com` for a verification email
   - Click the verification link

4. **Test the Form**
   - Submit a test message through your contact form
   - Check your inbox (and spam folder) at `inmc050817@gmail.com`

## Alternative: Check Formspree Submissions

Even if emails aren't working, you can see all submissions in your Formspree dashboard:
- Go to https://formspree.io/forms
- Click on your form
- View the "Submissions" tab to see all form submissions

## Troubleshooting:

- **Check Spam Folder**: Emails might be going to spam
- **Verify Email Address**: Make sure `inmc050817@gmail.com` is verified in Formspree
- **Check Formspree Dashboard**: All submissions are logged there even if emails fail
- **Free Plan Limits**: Free plan has 50 submissions/month limit

## If Emails Still Don't Work:

The code now includes `_to: recipientEmail` in the request, but Formspree may require the email to be set in the dashboard. Check your Formspree form settings to ensure the recipient email is configured there.
